Build an addon for Blender 3d which makes it easy for the user to generate motion graphics from text input. Addon should achieve production through geometry nodes so that the user can dive in and make fin adjustments if they know how to use blender. Make it so that there are templates to choose from where each template is a different geometry node graph. All the user needs to do is provide some text and the system should be able to be reasy to generate a complete scene including animation, camera movement, and lighting. Users can make their own templates by copying existing node trees and changing them.

Okay thats a nice web app. I like it. But it's not what I had in mind. A blender addon does not have a user interface since Blender, the 3D creator desktop application is itself the interface. Blender addons are also written in python, using the appropriate API and coding conventions. Also, Geometry nodes are not a concept, they are actually a structure inside the Blender any given blender project

Okay, here's how we can make this doable and not complex at all. Geometry Nodes as something called a "node tool" which is basically a node-group that produces 3D content. Make the plugin so that provides a list of templates based on .blend files in the same folder as the project file that have the "mograph_" prefix in the file name. That way, the code does not have to concern itself the creation of the node tree. Let the node trees (mograph templates) be crowd-sources. I can provide a couple of basic examples in the form of a blend file at some point, but for now, just provide the interface you suggestion which is the n menu with an input box where the text to be rendered (via the node tool) is entered. There's no prompting aspect to this addon. The addon doesn't have to process natural language inputs from the user. Lets call the addon MoText. Give the user the option of selecting an existing blender object to be used as input as an alternative to supplying text in the text field. That way people can insert things like products into the node tool. It is assumed that the node tool will supply lighting and cameras. Just deal with that for now, we will worry about the animation aspect of it later.
